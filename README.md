# vkRaster

Simple Vulkan Renderer That I've began to work on. The purpose is to learn about the API and how to write efficient code on it.

# Features

The project has just started, right now it can only display a white triangle on screen and have some classes that will be useful later on.

It is supposed to contain the next features:
- Scene loading from gtlf files.
- GPU driven rendering.
- Frustum and occlusion culling.
- PBR materials.
- Defferred rendering.
- Postprocessing with tone-mapping.
- Bloom

# Build

Right now I dont offer any build info, once the most basic features have been implemented I will so.

The project uses CMake for building, but right now not all dependencies are embebbed in the source code, so it is not portable. However, They all
will be included once the project is in a more matured state.
